Let us assume that you have a daily electricity consumption as shown
in a Sample time series (your values will be different):
1255
1456
1256
1311
1578
1339
1305
1494
1465
1650
1362
1261
1159
1364
...
...

If you use the last seven days to predict the eighth dataset,
corresponding data file:
1255.00,1456.00,1256.00,1311.00,1578.00,1339.00,1305.00,1494.00
1456.00,1256.00,1311.00,1578.00,1339.00,1305.00,1494.00,1465.00
1256.00,1311.00,1578.00,1339.00,1305.00,1494.00,1465.00,1650.00
1311.00,1578.00,1339.00,1305.00,1494.00,1465.00,1650.00,1362.00
1578.00,1339.00,1305.00,1494.00,1465.00,1650.00,1362.00,1261.00
1339.00,1305.00,1494.00,1465.00,1650.00,1362.00,1261.00,1159.00
1305.00,1494.00,1465.00,1650.00,1362.00,1261.00,1159.00,1364.00
...
...
</pre>

Note: You have to repeat this for daily, hourly, and fifteen-minute
consumption.

You should try different history for independent variables.

For example, to predict hourly consumption, you can use:
- previous hour
- same hour of the previous day
- same hour of the same day of the previous week

Split the dataset into train and test datasets to see if
the results are comparable.

Use ten-fold cross validation for the above techniques

Run multilayer perceptron, linear regression, support vector machine, Holt-Winters,
and ARIMA(p,0,q) on the dataset file for the entire dataset.

Your report should compare error statistics for
all the runs.

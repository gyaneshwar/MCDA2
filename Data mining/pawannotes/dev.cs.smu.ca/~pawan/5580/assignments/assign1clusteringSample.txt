The following is a sample session of clustering using revenue and number of baskets in which the products appear.  The session is captured as it progressed.  It may include some of the commands that were wrong and were subsequently corrected. 

Extract the revenue and number of baskets from the database.

create table productRevenueBasket as
SELECT `ITEM_SK`,sum(`SELLING_RETAIL_AMT`) as revenue,
count(distinct `TRANSACTION_RK`) as baskets from dataset01.sales219
group by `ITEM_SK`


Choose top 2000 products.


create table productcluster as
SELECT * FROM `productRevenueBasket`
ORDER BY `productRevenueBasket`.`revenue`  DESC
limit 0,2000


Download the productcluster.csv and cluster using the following R command:


prod<-read.csv("productcluster.csv",header=F)
prod
summary(prod)
km = kmeans(prod[,2:3],5,150)
km$centers
km$size
km = kmeans(prod[2:nrow(prod),2:3],5,150)
km$size
summary(prod)
summary(prod[2:2000,])
summary(prod[9:2000,])
summary(prod[10:2000,])
nprod=prod
nprod[,2]=nprod[,2]/mean(nprod[,2])
nprod[,2]=nprod[,3]/mean(nprod[,3])
summary(nprod)
nprod=prod
nprod[,2]=nprod[,2]/mean(nprod[,2])
nprod[,3]=nprod[,3]/mean(nprod[,3])
summary(nprod)
km = kmeans(nprod[,2:3],5,150)
km$center
km$size
source("clusterAccessories.r")
withinSSrange(nprod[,2:3], 3, 15, 150)


Here, the clusterAccessories.r file is as follows:

withinSSrange <- function(data,low,high,maxIter)
{
   withinss = array(0, dim=c(high-low+1));
   for(i in low:high)
   {
      withinss[i-low+1] <- kmeans(data, i, maxIter)$tot.withinss
   }
   withinss
}




# We have decided that the numbers of clusters is 6

nkm=kmeans(nprod[,2:3],6,150)
nkm$centers
nkm$size

# Denormalize the centers
realCenters = nkm$centers

# Note that 1 in realCenters matches 2 in nprod
realCenters[,1]=mean(prod[,2])*realCenters[,1]
realCenters[,2]=mean(prod[,3])*realCenters[,2]

realCenters

#column bind the columns
clusteredProd=cbind(prod,nkm$cluster)

#Make sure that the binding is proper
clusteredProd[1:20,]
nkm$cluster[1:20]

#write the clustered products out
write(t(clusteredProd),file="clusteredProducts.csv",sep=',',ncolumns=4)


Import clusteredProducts.csv into your database. Join it with dataset01.items.

SELECT p . * , i.ITEM_ENG_DESC AS name
FROM  `clusteredProducts` AS p, dataset01.items AS i
WHERE p.`ITEM_SK` = i.`ITEM_SK` 


Use the realCenters, clusteredProducts and the product names to write profiles for each cluster.

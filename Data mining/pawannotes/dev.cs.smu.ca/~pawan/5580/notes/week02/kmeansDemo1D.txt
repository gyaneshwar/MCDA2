10
100

Assume 7 and 9 to be initial centroids c1, and c2

All the objects belong to cluster 2, because they are closer to 9 as opposed to 7
Calculate the centroid c1.

c1 = 0/0 = 0 (not mathematically right)
c2 = sum of all the objects/11 = 556/11 = 50.54

Recalculate the membership
c1: 23 12 21 22 10 = 88/5 = 17.6

c2: 45 67 78 88 90 100 = 468/6 = 78

Recalculate the membership
c1: 23 12 21 22 10 45 = 133/6 = 22.16

c2: 67 78 88 90 100 = 423/5 = 84.6

Recalculate the membership
c1: 23 12 21 22 10 45 = 133/6 = 22.16

c2: 67 78 88 90 100 = 423/5 = 84.6
